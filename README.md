# ELP-RNN-TimeSeries

Collaboration with Shalom Mwiti.

This project focuses on developing a model to detect elephants in dense environments. It involves training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with different architectures (LSTM & GRU) using TensorFlow. The project also includes visualizing the model architecture and training history. Key processes include handling TFRecord datasets, applying safe normalization, and creating windowed sequences for model input.
