# ELP-RNN-TimeSeries
Collaboration with Shalom Mwiti

Developing two distinct RNN architectures *(LSTM RNN and GRU RNN)* to compare their effectiveness in detecting elephants using infrasound rumbles. The model analyzes 5-second segments of rumbles, applying filters to eliminate extraneous noise, thereby improving prediction accuracy. Using time series analysis, the model measures the rumbles by identifying a stretched sine wave, which in our case corresponds to infrasound at 10 Hz.
